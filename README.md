# Image Manipulation Using Python Libraries: cv2 and PIL

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this repository are:
- To demonstrate various image manipulation techniques using Python libraries, specifically OpenCV and PIL.
- To provide examples and code snippets that illustrate how to perform common tasks such as resizing, cropping, filtering, and rotating images.
- To create a foundation for further exploration of image processing and computer vision applications.

## Description
This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that showcase image manipulation techniques using the following libraries:

- **OpenCV (cv2)**: A powerful library for computer vision tasks that provides tools for reading, writing, and processing images in various formats. It is widely used in both academic and commercial applications.
  
- **Pillow (PIL)**: A fork of the original Python Imaging Library (PIL), Pillow is easy to use and provides extensive capabilities for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

### Features
- **Basic Operations**: Load, save, and display images.
- **Image Transformations**: Resize, rotate, and flip images.
- **Filtering**: Apply various filters to enhance or modify images.
- **Drawing Shapes**: Add text and shapes to images for annotation.
- **Color Space Conversion**: Convert between different color spaces (e.g., RGB to grayscale).

### Usage
To get started, clone this repository and ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow
